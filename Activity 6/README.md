 ###  This React app, fetches data from the local JSON file named "album.json" using the Axios library. It displays a list of albums and their details, such as title, description, and image, in a card format. The app also includes a search functionality where users can enter a search term, and the album list will be filtered dynamically to show only the albums that match the search phrase. The "SearchForm" component handles the user input and triggers the filtering process. The app uses useEffect to load the albums on component mount and useState to manage searchPhrase and albumList state..
