   ## Research Questions 
   1. The @Input decorator in info.component.ts marks a property as an input, allowing values to be passed into the component from its parent component.
   2. The [value] attribute in info.component.html is used to bind the value of an option in a select element to a property or expression in the component's code.
   3. The [(ngModel)] directive in info.component.html enables two-way data binding, allowing the value of an input field to be synchronized between the component's code and the view.
