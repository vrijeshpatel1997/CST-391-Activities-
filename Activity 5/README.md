 ###  This project is a simple React web application that displays a list of albums by The Beatles. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the album data, and it renders each album as a card using the `Card` component. The cards show the album title, description, and a button. When the app is rendered, it displays the list of Beatles albums with their respective details and album cover images.
